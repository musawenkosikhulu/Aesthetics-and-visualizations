# Aesthetics-and-visualizations
I learned about and worked with ggplot2, an R package for data visualization. In this activity, Iâ€™ll follow through a scenario and continue to apply ggplot2 to tailor aesthetic features of visualizations.
By the end of this activity, I will be able to use R to create bar charts, update chart labels, and customize the aesthetics of a visualization by specific criteria. This will enable you to make more complex visualizations to demonstrate your findings.
